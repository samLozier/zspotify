  -ls, --liked-songs   Downloads all the liked songs from your account
  -pid, --playlist-id [id] [folder_name]  Downloads a playlist from their id and saves in folder_name. This playlist can be created by other user, not only your playlists. 

Special hardcoded options:
  ROOT_PATH           Change this path if you don't like the default directory where ZSpotify saves the music

  SKIP_EXISTING_FILES Set this to False if you want ZSpotify to overwrite files with the same name rather than skipping the song

  MUSIC_FORMAT        Set this to "ogg" if you would rather that format audio over "mp3"
  RAW_AUDIO_AS_IS     Set this to True to only stream the audio to a file and do no re-encoding or post processing
